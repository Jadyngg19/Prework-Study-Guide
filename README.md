# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is the start of my coding journey. I am going to use this project to put in my notes from my upcoming class on coding and keep altering it to my liking as I keep learning more about coding. This webpage is also going to help me keep my notes organized. So far, I seem to have learned some of the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to make this webpage. I am excited to see how much I can alter this webpage to show off what coding I have learned and use it as a testing/practice platform for myself.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I will be using this webpage to keep my notes on HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Git in one place and in an organized manner. This will make it easy for me to find my noted in a timely manner in order to use them when I need them. I will also use it to test certian functions I learn to make in the future so I can see them on the webpage along with the console. The console can help me identify an error and then start debugging the code when needed.
